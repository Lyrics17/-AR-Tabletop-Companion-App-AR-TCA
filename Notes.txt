Idea how to get armylist data:
    after a faction is selected in the dropdown, a query is triggered with selects all units in this faction with the userID FK (add to unit table in ER dia!)
    this data fills the textfields. Same logic for the detachment dropdown. the selected faction option needs to be passed to the next scene 

    next Scene:
    Battlesize dropdown, selected units, pointscost, powerlevel should be filled with the data form the db if the user already created a armylist for the chosen faction. Else just leave them empty / "Bitte auswählen" for the dropdown 

    When the "Kontingent hinzufügen" Button is clicked the dropdown is reseted and the previous chosen detachment isnt more available as a option



TODO: CreateArmylist Scene: When Dropdown for unit is changed to something else than "Bitte auswaehlen" make QRCode Button interactable, get the unitId of the chosen unit and generate the qr code //v2: put the QRCode Button between the points and power counter to make if more obvious what function the button has

TODO: DBManager -> also get the id of the logged in user for arscene image recovery (get qrCode of every unit where userFK = userID)
 Or use the name of the qr code as select var 

TODO: Save QR-Codes of Marker and every Terrain for image targeting -> in DB or on device 

ARScene: Marker scale von 0.4f ergeben einen 6" großen radius

TODO: Doku: Gib die Masse für den idealen QR Code an! -> mach ne bedinungsanleitung

TODO: Fix bug where marker doesnt spawn after the user leaves the ar scene
