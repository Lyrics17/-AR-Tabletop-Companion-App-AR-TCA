## What's AR-TCA?
The AR tabletop companion app is designed to help new players of the Warhammer 40K game system find their way around the game more quickly. For this purpose, the app displays the movement range of a unit utilizing an indicator, which is projected on the screen using AR technology. In addition, new units can be uploaded by the user, new army lists can be created and edited, terrain properties can be easily accessed via the app, and the profile values of the units can be looked up.
